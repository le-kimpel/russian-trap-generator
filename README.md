# russian-trap-generator
Silly side project where I play around with generating Russian rap-song text. Studying a language is more fun when you play around with it in its foulest, least-grammatical, most-inventive forms.

I use a LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) RNN to generate about 100 words of Russian-language text (given some seed text), which is pulled from a large dataset of complete rap song lyrics.
